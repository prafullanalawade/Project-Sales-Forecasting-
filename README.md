# Sales Forecasting

## 📘 Overview

The **Sales Forecasting** project aims to predict the sales price of retail items across different outlets using machine learning techniques. By analyzing factors such as product weight, fat content, outlet location type, and establishment year, the model provides valuable insights to support better inventory and business planning decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning regression model capable of forecasting item sales with high accuracy and helping retailers make data-driven decisions.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Predicts item sales using **Random Forest Regression** with approximately **72% accuracy**.
* Analyzes the impact of key factors like outlet location, product attributes, and establishment year.
* Visualizes feature relationships and sales patterns through detailed data analysis.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and prepared the dataset for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify patterns and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical variables and optimized feature selection.
4. **Model Training:** Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** for sales prediction.
5. **Evaluation:** Achieved about **72% accuracy** using R² Score and RMSE metrics.
